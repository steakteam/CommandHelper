/**
 * This class performs a check to see if this is an upgrade, and if so,
 * can be used to perform various upgrades. The upgrade log is updated with
 * information about upgrade history, so upgrade actions are not performed
 * unnecessarily.
 * <p>
 * In general, this class is used in one of two ways. The first way is the ideal
 * way, and should be always be preferred in all cases where it can be done. The second
 * way is a universal fallback, for if the preferred method can't be done for
 * whatever reason.
 * <p>
 * Ideally, you will do feature detection, to see if an upgrade routine needs to
 * be performed. This is done by checking the status of the existing setup, and if
 * it is in a particular state (the old state), returning true from doRun, then
 * running the actual upgrade task in the run method.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes this is too difficult to do, or it would be ambiguous as to whether
 * or not the upgrade has been run previously. In this case, you can check for
 * breadcrumbs that may have been left in a previous run. If the breadcrumbs don't
 * exist, then you still need to do some amount of detection to ensure that this
 * isn't the first run, but other than that, you can assume that if the breadcrumb
 * is missing, you should run the upgrade task. Then, at the end of the upgrade task,
 * you must be sure to leave the breadcrumb. There are protected methods in
 * {@link UpgradeTask} to assist with this, which manage actually persisting the
 * breadcrumbs with the installation.
